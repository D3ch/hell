# Bottom Page

I'm not leaving forever, but this project will get archived. If you use any of the code, please credit me or the original owners.

This was a massive learning experience for me. I'm thankful for everyone who supported me along the way and still use this project. 

This won't officially get archived, since I might add a bit of code here and there. But I will stop working on this for the long run.

Again, thank you everyone for everything. All of you are way more than I could ever ask for. It was nice working on this project,
