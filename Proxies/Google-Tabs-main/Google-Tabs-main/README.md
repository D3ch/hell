# Installation and Setup

Installation of Ultraviolet is simple. You can find a Tl;DR of the installation and setup process just below. If you are unfamiliar with the "standard" installation process, look a bit farther down for a more comprehensive installation and setup guide.

## Replit Setup Guide

To setup on Replit, first click on the "Run on Replit" button. After loading into your repl, click on the green "Run" button. Alternatively, run the following commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ chmod +x main.sh
$ ./main.sh
```

You will only have to run the second command once. It just allows `main.sh` to be executed. By running `main.sh`, you will update any submodules and will start the app.

**Note**: If you choose not to use `main.sh`, but would rather just run all commands manually, please note that you will have to manually install submodules by running `git update submodules --init`. Without it, `static` will not be installed, and that is a required directory.
